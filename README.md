This is a final project from online course of Machine Learning.

In here we have dataset of hands gesture of paper, rock, and scissors. 
The case is we will train a model with those datasets to make the program can predict or identify a new given picture, whenever it is rock, paper, or scissors.
To solve the case, the program uses Convolutional Neural Network to train the dataset which will be divided with ratio 80% for training and 20% for validating the model.

The dataset can be downloaded in here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tp38Cgfr9382CMVc7-_5augpE-8Yk-Ex/view?usp=sharing
